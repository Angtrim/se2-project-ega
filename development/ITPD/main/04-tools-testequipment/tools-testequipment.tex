During the integration test, the team should use the following tools:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \nameref{sub:manual}
	\item \nameref{sub:arquillian}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Manual} % (fold)
\label{sub:manual}

We will use manual testing when the integration testing will need mock data.
For instance, test [I2] will need some example data in order to be properly tested, as desccribed is section \ref{sec:program_stubs_and_test_data_required}.
This is the only reason why the integration will ever require manual testing.

\subsection{Arquillian + JUnit} % (fold)
\label{sub:arquillian}
Arquillian, together with JUnit, provides a simple, flexible and pluggable integration testing environment.
This tool will be used because it minimizes the burden on the testing team to carry out integration testing by handling all aspects of test execution.
