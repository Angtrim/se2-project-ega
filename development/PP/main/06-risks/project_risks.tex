\subsection{Project risks}

\begin{description}

\item[Delays] The development of this project could slow down or stop for a period for reasons that are external of this company and we may not have any control on them. In case of delays we will release an Alpha/Beta version and then we will continue the development using an Extreme Programming modality.

\item[Communication Issues] Developer and designer will often work remotely. This can cause some coomunication issue or misunderstanding, to avoid them we will use a strict and clear communication pattern applied with tools created for this kind of situation. (i.e. Slack, Trello ecc.)

\item[Lack of programming experience with specific framework] The team has no experience in programming using JavaEE, this could cause some delays.

\item[Requirement changes] Requirements could change while the team is developing. Writing a clean, reusable and well structured code will be fundamental to face this risk.
