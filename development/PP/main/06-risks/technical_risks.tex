\subsection{Technical risks}

\begin{description}

    \item[System fail] System could go down for a period for technical reason, a emergency cluster of servers will guarantee that the service will just slow down avoiding the complete interruption.

    \item[Bad written code] The code can become less usable and extensible with time, a good Design Document and a periodic code review will reduce this risk.

    \item[Data loss] Hardware or software issue may cause a data loss. It will be very important to have a reliable back up plan to reduce the effect of this eventuality.

    \item[Data leaks] Users data may be leaked with some deliberate attack to our servers. Testing security and cripting data movements will reduce drastically this risk.
