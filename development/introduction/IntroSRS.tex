\subsection{Scope}

The aim of the system being presented in this document is to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Make the process of requesting a service intuitive for any kind of user.
\item Lower the time required from a user to request or book a taxi. Request time is less than 30 seconds, booking time is less than 1,5 minutes.
\item Enable the user to take advantage of the taxi service from a wide range of locations, namely from every location where the user has access to an Internet enabled device that can run the application.
\item Guarantee a fair management of the taxi queue by minimizing the idle time of every taxi driver using the service.
\end{itemize}
To accommodate these goals the following pieces of software will have to be developed:

\begin{description}
  \item[Mobile application] \hfill \\
  The mobile application is available for all major mobile OS (Android, iOS, Windows Mobile, Blackberry).
  There are two different version of the app, one specifically addressed to the \emph{taxi user}, another one specifically addressed to the \emph{taxi driver}.

  The former gives the \emph{user} the opportunity to manage his profile, request a taxi and make or dismiss a reservation.
  The latter enables the \emph{taxi} driver to accept a request issued from the system or dismiss it, signal any problem to the operators.

  \item[Web application] \hfill \\
  The web application is thought to an alternate way for the \emph{taxi user} to manage his profile, request a taxi and make or dismiss a reservation.

  \item[Back-end] \hfill \\
  The back-end is the application that manages the request system and queue system.

  \item[Control Panel]
  The control panel is the application used by the \emph{operator} to have an overall view of the whole system, issue warnings to users or taxi drivers.
