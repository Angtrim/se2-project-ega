This section focuses on policies and data storing management.\\
\subsection{Data Policy} % (fold)
\label{sub:data_policy}
\subsubsection{Automatic data elimination} % (fold)
\label{ssub:data_elimination}
Data about \emph{Users} and \emph{Taxi Drivers} is never automatically eliminated from the system.\\
However rides log are kept for 12 months to save storage space and to speed up queries.

\subsubsection{Data caching policy} % (fold)
\label{ssub:data_caching}
In order to reduce the load on the \emph{Server} and to speed up user's query response, all the data that does not change frequently (like the user's profile data) is saved locally on the device and reloaded only when a modification of the profile occurs.

Here is a presentation of the data base schema that will have to be employed:

\subsubsection{ER Diagram analysis} % (fold)
\label{ssub:er_diagram_analysis}

The database schema is relatively simple and slim.
Here is an explanation of all the entities and relations:

\paragraph{Entities} % (fold)
\label{par:entities}
The schema is composed of a total of 6 entities:

\begin{itemize}
	\item {\textbf{Operator}} \\
		Its primary is a unique ID, and it is the number of his/her identity card.
		Some of his/her personal information is stored, together with the date in wich he/she was employed.
	\item {\textbf{User}} \\
		Its primary is a unique ID, and it is the number of his/her identity card.
		Some of his/her personal information is stored, together with the date in wich he/she registered to the service.
	\item {\textbf{TaxiDriver}} \\
		Its primary is a unique ID, and it is the number of his/her identity card.
		Some of his/her personal information is stored, together with the date in wich he/she registered to the service.
		The taxi license is also stored for this entity.
	\item {\textbf{TaxiCar}} \\
		Its primary is the license plate. Each \emph{TaxiCar} has also the number of passenger seats available.
	\item {\textbf{Ride}} \\
