In order to have a successful deployment an in depth analysis of the main components that will have to be deployed is required.

For this reason here is a diagram showing the \emph{Deployment View}:

This diagram shows a two-tier architecture.

A main server is deployed: in this node the \emph{mySQL DataBase} is executed. This is also where the \emph{Back-End Application} will be deployed.

Both mobile applications, the \emph{User} one and the \emph{Taxi Driver} one, interface with the \emph{\nameref{par:back_end_application}} through \emph{HTTP} protocol.
Also the PC application, namely the \emph{Web Application}, connects to \emph{\nameref{par:back_end_application}}.
