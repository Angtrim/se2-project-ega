\section{Components Interfaces} % (fold)
\label{sec:components_interfaces}
This section provides a description of the interfaces between the main components of the system.\\
Internal interfaces between different objects of every component are described in \emph{section \ref{sec:component_view}}
\subsection{Back-End Application - Database} % (fold)
\label{sub:back_end_application_database}
The \emph{Back-End Application} uses \emph{SQL} language to query the \emph{Database}. Queries from \emph{Java} are supported by the \emph{Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API} which is the \emph{API is the industry standard for database-independent connectivity between the Java programming language and a wide range of SQL databases}\footnote{See \url{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/jdbc/index.html}}.\\
This choice is made in order to exploit the \emph{"Write Once, Run Anywhere"} feature of the \emph{JDBC}.

\subsection{Back-End Application - Client User} % (fold)
\label{sub:back_end_application_client_user}
The connection between the \emph{Back-End Application} and the \emph{Client User} is provided by the Internet network and based on the \emph{HTTP} protocol and supported by a \emph{RESTful API} service.\\
The two components use different internal interfaces to connect to the network\footnote{See \emph{section \ref{sec:component_view}}}.

\subsection{Back-End Application - Client Taxi Driver} % (fold)
\label{sub:back_end_application_client_taxi}
The connection between the \emph{Back-End Application} and the \emph{Client Taxi Driver} is provided by the Internet network and based on the \emph{HTTP} protocol and supported by a \emph{RESTful API} service.\\
The two components use different internal interfaces to connect to the network.
