\section{High Level Components} % (fold)
\label{sec:high_level_components}
The system could be divide in three main high level components that not necessarily correspond only to one real application:
\begin{itemize}
	\item User Client
	\item Taxi Driver Client
	\item Server
\end{itemize}
The \textbf{Server} component is the kernel of the service we want to provide, it incorporates most of the \emph{business logic}, it stores most of the \emph{data} and it provides programmatic interfaces to the clients.\\\\
The \textbf{User Client} components is an high level representation of the real clients available to the users of our service. It's modeled as a \emph{thin client} and relies on the \emph{Server} to fulfill its tasks.\\\\
The \textbf{Taxi Driver Client} component is an high level representation of the real clients available to the taxi drivers registered aaa
