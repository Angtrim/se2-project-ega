\section{Component View} % (fold)
\label{sec:component_view}
This section highlights the main features and roles of every component of the system.
\subsection{\nameref{comp:server}} % (fold)
\label{sub:nameref_}
The \nameref{comp:server} is composed of:

\paragraph{Back-End Application} % (fold)
\label{par:back_end_application}\hfill \\
As stated in \emph{section 1.2.2} of the \emph{RASD}, the \emph{Back-End Application} is the system component that handles most of the business logic.\\
The application is written in \emph{Java EE} and to fulfill its tasks (see \emph{section 3.5.3} of the \emph{RASD}) it needs to interface with the Internet network using the \emph{HTTPS protocol} and the \emph{JAVA API for RESTful Web Service}\footnote{See \url{https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/}}, with a \emph{MySQL database} and with external Google Maps API.\\

\paragraph{MySQL Database} % (fold)
\label{par:mysql_database}\hfill \\
The MySQL database fulfills the task of storing and granting access to all the data generated and used by the service.\\
A \emph{database dump} is performed daily during the period of minor activity of the service \footnote{At first, when no activity data is available, the dump will be performed at 04:00 A.M}.\\
The connection between the \emph{Java EE} application and the database is supported by the \emph{JDBC connector}\footnote{See \url{http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/}}\\

\subsection{User Client} % (fold)
\label{sub:user_client}
Different real clients are available to the end users of the system.\\
As stated in \emph{section 1.2.2} of the \emph{RASD} a native mobile application is developed for Android, iOS, Blackberry and WP.\\
Moreover a Web Application is also available.\\
To fulfill the requirements expressed in \emph{section 3.5.1} and \emph{section 3.5.2} of the \emph{RASD}, all the clients need to communicate with the \nameref{comp:server} making calls to the REST API using platform specific API for REST HTTP calls.
