\label{sub:assumptions_and_dependencies}
\subsubsection{Domain Assumptions} 
\label{ssub:domain}
We assume that the system will be deployed in a city of about 1.5M inhabitants with about 4800 regular licensed taxi drivers.\\
We assume that at launch time the \emph{\nameref{app:mobileuser}} will reach an audience of about 100k users while the \emph{\nameref{app:web}} will reach an audience of about 10k users.\\
We assume that the city is dived in \emph{\nameref{def:taxi_zone}}.
\subsubsection{Taxi Driver Assumptions} 
We assume that every taxi driver will have a compatible device  \footnote{See section \ref{sub:constraints} on page \pageref{sub:constraints}} (personal or provided by the project client) with a working GPS module.\\
We assume that our system and the \emph{\nameref{def:operator}} have access to an internal database of valid taxi licenses of the city.\\
We assume that a taxi can have at most 6 passengers.\\
We assume that a taxi ride always ends and that exceptional problems are solved outside the system.
\subsubsection{User Assumptions} 
\label{ssub:user_assumptions}
We assume that every user will have a device with an enabled Internet connection.\\
We also assume that the location provided by the user (manually or automatically via GPS) is always correct.
\subsubsection{Taxi Driver Assumptions} 
\label{ssub:driver_assumptions}
We assume that the taxi driver has to send his personal information (license number, name, surname, C.F.) via email to the support address to get valid login credentials.\\ 
We assume that every taxi driver handles all his rides with our application.
